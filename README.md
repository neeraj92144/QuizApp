###### How to use code and run in device or simulator ######

# unzip the code first. For MAC just needed to tap once on the zip file it will automatically started unzip one the same place then you can access the findQuiz directory. For android Windows need to download winrar or winzip software on windows machine. Then then needed to do right click on code zip then you might find option for winrar or windup under that there will be option to extract the zip file , it will also ask for the location where we want to unzip our code, so we can provide that also and access findQuiz director

# Go to inside the findQuiz directory and open that directory with command line tool and type flutter doctor command to check whether flutter is install and up and running already. If it say no doctor command found. Mean flutter is not setup properly. You can above this file can check Prerequisite to run the project.

# Now if flutter started running successfully then you can open your application on Android Studio or other IDE for your preference. I am demostrtaring through Android Studio here.
So just needed to open android studio and from there we will open our project. After project open, then needed to check, flutter developer android plugin install or not. For that you needed to go ( File / or for Mac tap on apple button top left )  and then tap on Preference option then it will open a pop up in middle just needed to go in plugin section and search for flutter , now flutter plugin will be there in search just needed to install from there. After that needed to go in Language & Frameworks -> Dart -> Dart SDK path. So in (Dart SDK path) option we just needed to provide the flutter SDK path there that we already downloaded and set the path earlier. So here just needed to put SDK path then we are good to go.


# Now we needed check, project structure there, Where you will find (pubspect.yaml) file and now on top you will have option pub get just tap on it and all dependence for the project refresh not any issue with dependency already.

# Now we can conenct our device or select simulator from top bar of device , just needed to select it and just right that we will find option of play ( run ) then we can tap on it and run the project successfully and see the what is in the application.
